# Flashcard-Generator
Back - end flash card generator

This back-end application uses node.js to allow users to create two types of flashcards. 
	a. Basic --> the user can set the text for both the front and the back of the flashcard as arguments
	b. Cloze --> the user can create a statement and then hide part of the text
